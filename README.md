### About Me
A software engineering graduate with a lifelong fascination for technology, demonstrated through building full-stack web applications and exploring emerging technologies. Through personal projects and continuous learning, I'm developing practical solutions that solve real-world problems.

### Technical Foundation
I have built a versatile skillset across both enterprise-grade backends and modern mobile frameworks. My expertise spans **Java (Spring Boot)** and **C# (ASP.NET)** for robust server-side logic, while using **Flutter** and **React Native** to craft seamless cross-platform mobile experiences. I am also proficient in database management—from **PostgreSQL** to **MySQL**—ensuring that data is not just stored, but optimized and secured.

### Education Path
Currently in my final semester. Beyond the classroom, I am actively pursuing knowledge in **Cybersecurity**, focusing on secure coding practices and network defense to better understand the security landscape of modern applications.

### Projects
* **Somaliland Currency Exchange API:** A live, open-source financial utility with Java Spring Boot and PostgreSQL.
* **Dhawr Platform:** A multi-service delivery startup currently in development using Flutter and Laravel.
* **JazakPro app** https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jazak.pro

### Current Focus
I am currently scaling the **Somaliland Exchange API** into a full developer platform and preparing for my graduation in April 2026. I am actively seeking impactful opportunities in **Software Engineering** where I can leverage my hybrid engineering and security mindset.

### My Philosophy
I believe that technology is the greatest equalizer. My goal is not just to write code, but to build tools that empower communities and businesses. Whether it's debugging a complex Java microservice, hardening a Linux server, or refining a Flutter animation, I approach every task with precision, curiosity, and a relentless drive to ship products that matter.
