### About Me
I am a Software Engineer and student at **George Brown College** with a deep drive for building digital infrastructure. My journey has taken me from Kenya and Somalia to Toronto, giving me a unique global perspective on solving problems. I specialize in **Full-Stack Web** and **Mobile Development**, creating high-performance applications that bridge gaps in financial technology and digital services.

### Technical Foundation
I have built a versatile skillset across both enterprise-grade backends and modern mobile frameworks. My expertise spans **Java (Spring Boot)** and **C# (ASP.NET)** for robust server-side logic, while using **Flutter** and **React Native** to craft seamless cross-platform mobile experiences. I am comfortable navigating the entire stack, from Linux servers to pixel-perfect UI.

### Education Path
Currently in my final semester of the **Computer Programming (T186)** program at George Brown College (Dean's List / High Performance). My academic focus has been on distributed systems, database management, and object-oriented architecture, which I immediately apply to real-world deployments.

### Project Experience
I believe in "Deploying, not just Coding." My recent work includes:
* **Somaliland Currency Exchange API:** A live, open-source financial utility deployed on a Linux VPS using Java Spring Boot and PostgreSQL.
* **Dhawr Platform:** A multi-service delivery startup currently in development using Flutter and Laravel.
* **Mobile Apps:** Experience building native and cross-platform solutions using Kotlin and React Native.

### Current Focus
I am currently scaling the **Somaliland Exchange API** into a full developer platform and preparing for my graduation in April 2026. I am actively seeking impactful opportunities in **Software Engineering** where I can leverage my hybrid web/mobile background.

### My Philosophy
I believe that technology is the greatest equalizer. My goal is not just to write code, but to build tools that empower communities and businesses. Whether it's debugging a complex Java microservice or refining a Flutter animation, I approach every task with precision, curiosity, and a relentless drive to ship products that matter.
